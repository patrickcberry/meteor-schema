# meteor-schema

Demo project for simple schema, collections2 and autoforms in Meteor

Working through this [tutorial](http://www.webtempest.com/meteor-js-autoform-tutorial)

Issues with the tutorial:
+ Cannot create a new record with the userId field defined. Added a default value to the schema and deleted (if required in the before insert function) 

## Methods

The tutorial has been duplicated using methods.
